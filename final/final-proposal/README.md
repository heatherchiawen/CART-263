# Template p5 project
Final Project Prototype - Particle Board 
Heather  Chester 

For my final project, I propose working with ml5 handpose and p5.js to create a sound visualizing program. 
This prototype operates by using the ml5 handpose model to detect where sounds are mapped on the canvas. 
The program then analyzes the sound output and move static (or particles) accordingly. 
 
Please see "Final Project Propsal" file for my written propsal and more information.
