# Voice Jam - Predetermined Matchmaker 
## Heather Chester 

As per the season, this simulation is a take on the typical matchmaking Valentines festivities. Adressing the current climate for service workers and students in Quebec who are cureently being subject to either unlivable wages or threatened tuition hikes. As there have been a rise in protests these past few months, I thought it might be fitting to indluge my frustration, as a out-of-province student, in the smear of those who are ultimately reponsible.
